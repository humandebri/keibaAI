## Conclusion

The current system has a solid foundation with comprehensive historical data but lacks the sophisticated derived features essential for profitable betting. The missing 60+ features represent a significant opportunity for improvement. By implementing the phased approach outlined above, the system can realistically achieve expected value > 1.0 within 2-3 weeks.

The academic research confirms that speed ratings, relative rankings, and performance trends are among the most predictive features. The proposed implementation plan prioritizes these high-impact features while building toward a complete feature set that matches modern academic standards.
